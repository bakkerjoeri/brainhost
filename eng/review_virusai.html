<b>Story</b><br>
<u>Chapter 0.1: The beginning</u><br>
The company: PD: RAI [Practical Design: Robotic Artificial Intelligence] has finally discovered the technology to make robots able to learn and think for theyr own. With this technology, robots can recognize items as we can (when one has different models of chairs, they can still recognize it as a chair) and they can, for example, think about in what way pieces of filth must be cleaned. They put this technology in all of theyr robots. Then you can set up what they must do in general. Later, these robots became so advanced, that they could think for themselves; what they must do, what they can do and even state what they want. Suddenly, one robot turns against his host family and blows himself up. It wounded the people.<br>
PD: RAI pays the media and other publicities money to supress the news. The number of �uprisings� is growing, and robots even start to gang up to rise against men. People are dieing and PD: RAI is still trying to keep the commotion quiet. Because of this, no one has been able to take measures against the attacks. The robots massively rise up and war is at hand.<br>
<br>
<u>Chapter 0.2 Imprisoning</u><br>
The war is terrible. Robots have conquered factories and started reproducing themselves massivly. But the robots seem to act strange. They are trying not to kill anyone. In stead, they take revenge by making men theyr slaves. At first, they let the humans work while they where at conciousness. Later, they develop a C.C. [Commanding Coma]. This is not really a coma. You are still (in some way) at conciousness, but you can�t think for yourself. You are controlled by a Command Centre, which is controlled by your host robot. You don�t feel, see or remember anything of the C.C. Another thing is, that your brains are upgraded to A.I. In this case, this doesn�t mean Artificial Intelligence. This is �Added Intelligence�. People with Added Intelligence are good and strong in everything, as well physicly as mentally. They also recieve high intelligence because of it.<br>
<br>
<u><a name="hs1">Chapter 1: The Awakening</a></u><br>
You have fought in war. You�ve been captured and your brain has been upgraded to A.I. and you are in a C.C. You are being used as an anti-virus �slave�. You must destroy virusses with high-tech programs, like programs as Norton do nowadays. This is going on for a long time... Untill one of your missions goes fataly wrong. The Command Center and your host robot are destroyed. You wander in the distorted world for a while untill you join a freedom move that wants human freedom back.<br>
<i>Untill here goes the story of Virus A.I. 1.1. The rest of the story will be published when Virus A.I. 1.2 is in progress.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Game system</b><br>
When you enter a level, you will start with a piece of platform gameplay. The meaning of this piece is to enter a building and destroy the virusses on the infected computers. You will be hunted by robots which are infected and thereby have become programmed to fight intruders. Every once in a while, you will be helped by other humans or robots.<br>
When you�ve reached the computer, you will start the fase of the level, in which you fight against a virus. You must do this by strategicly downloading and running different scripts. With these scripts, you can weaken the virus and in the end: destroy it. You can defeat virusses in different ways. Some virusses must be destroyed by downloading the anti-script and further use this to weaken and destroy the virus. Some virusses are too strong to apply this method. You must weaken these in the same way shown before, but this time, make a backup, format and install that backup. If you do this the right way, the virus won�t be inside the backup. You must do all this in a certain time. The virus does damage to the infected computer and once the computer is too havely damaged, you lose.<br>
A few of the scripts that can be used against the virus are: Lower Attack, Stop Special Abilitie and Repair Damage. More will be announced soon.<br>
