I've decided to bring out different versions of Virus A.I.:<br>
- <u><a href="virusai1-1.html">Virus A.I. 1.1: The Awaking</a></u>, While in your C.C., you need to destroy virusses... Untill you wake up.<br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 1.2: Freedom Quest</u>, You go out to wake up more people out of theyr C.C.'s and decide to join a freedom move.<br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 1.3: Realm of Today</u>, You play as a colleague of yourself in his C.C. He travels to this year in a timemachine and must defeat virusses that exist now. Realistic because of the virusses out of this time.<br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 2: Virtual Strikeback</u>, A robot has stayed alive and holds on. He develops a virus that can control anything that is controlled by a computer. You, with your team, go out to destroy that virus and a new set of robots.<br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 0: History</u>, You play as the future leader of the freedom move. War is at hand and you must fight the uprising robots.<br>
<br>
I'm probably going to make the games in the following order:<br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 1.1</u><br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 1.2</u><br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 2</u><br>
- <u>Virus A.I. 0</u> or <u>Virus A.I. 1.3</u> (haven't decided yet)<br>
